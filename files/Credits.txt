- A big thanks to Triph (T4ils__) for extracting and uploading all Klonoa animations and models (rigged) on ModelResource, this mod couldn't have been done otherwise.
- Special thanks to Kell for fixing an interpolation issue with animations in SADX that allowed Klonoa to work properly in-game.
- Special thanks to ItsEasyActually for fixing many issues on the Blender SA addon that made the rendering of Klonoa much better and easier in-game.
- Life Icon from Klonoa Heroes ripped by Meta Warp.
- Some part of the mod code uses SA2 Sonic by MainMemory as a reference, specially to draw chunk model.
- Super Klonoa and nameplates texture and other graphic tweaks by SoloSlacker.
- Few custom Klonoa animations made from scratch by Chaorrin.
